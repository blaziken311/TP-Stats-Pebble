# TP-Stats-Pebble
Pebble application written in Pebble.js for accessing Tagpro stats from a REST endpoint.

### Description
This app is very, very, very not ready for release. Pebble.js is still not mature enough for necessary features such as persistent data storage. When these features are implemented in a new release of Pebble.js, they'll be implemented in-app.
